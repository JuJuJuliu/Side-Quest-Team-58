      <h1>About SideQuest!</h1>

      <div class="mission-box">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Connecting adventurers with those in need. We believe every quest, no
          matter how small, can make a big difference in someone's life!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-sectionAU">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          SideQuest! was born from a simple idea - in our busy world, many
          people need help with everyday tasks, while others have skills and
          time they'd like to share. We created this platform to bridge that
          gap, bringing together those who need assistance with willing helpers
          in a fun, adventurous way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inspired by the camaraderie and quest-based format of classic RPGs,
          SideQuest! transforms ordinary tasks into exciting missions. Whether
          you're posting a quest for assistance or taking on someone else's
          request, you're part of our growing community of real-life
          adventurers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since our launch, we've facilitated thousands of successful quests,
          from garden maintenance to computer repairs, grocery deliveries to pet
          sitting. Each completed quest strengthens our community and proves
          that a little help can go a long way.
